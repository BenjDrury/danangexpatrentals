# What to do when leads come in

Your job early is **not** building tech. Your job is becoming a **manual apartment concierge**. The website is the lead generator.

## Step 1 — Reply within 1 hour if possible

Speed builds trust.

**Reply template:**

```
Hey 👋 thanks for reaching out!

I help foreigners find apartments in Da Nang.
Let me check what's currently available for your budget.

A few quick questions:

• Are you already in Da Nang or relocating?
• When exactly do you want to move in?
• Is walking distance to the beach important?

I'll send you options shortly 👍
```

---

## Step 2 — Find apartments manually

**Sources:**

- Facebook groups (goldmine early)
- Vietnamese listing sites
- Zalo agents
- Telegram groups
- Google Maps serviced apartments

You only need to send **3–5 options max**. Curated beats volume.

---

## Step 3 — Send options like a concierge

**Format:**

```
Hey — here are a few apartments that match your budget:

Option 1 – Studio in An Thuong – $350
• balcony
• good reviews
• available now
Agent speaks basic English
👉 I can introduce you if you want

Option 2 – 1BR near beach – $480
• furnished
• quieter street
• flexible lease
👉 Want me to check availability?
```

This is where value happens. Not in the platform — in the curation.

---

## Step 4 — Offer introduction

When they like something:

- Introduce them to the agent, or
- Schedule a viewing, or
- Negotiate price, or
- Explain areas

That’s your product early.

---

## Step 5 — Track everything in a simple sheet

**Columns:**

| Lead name | Budget | Move date | Status | Source |
|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|--------|
| (from form) | (from form) | (from form) | new / sent options / viewing / rented | website / WhatsApp / referral |

This will later become your CRM logic.

---

## Why this approach works

You validate:

- Do people trust you?
- Do they respond to curated options?
- Do they actually rent?
- Which budgets convert? Which areas are hot? Which agents are reliable?

That’s real market intelligence you can’t scrape.

## Mindset

You are not building a website. You are building **the best expat housing concierge in Da Nang**. The website is just the lead generator.
